## Week 1
* Chromosome
1. Size. This is the easiest way to tell chromosomes apart.
2. Banding pattern. The size and location of Giemsa bands make each chromosome unique.
3. Centromere position. Centromeres appear as a constriction. They have a role in the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during cell division (mitosis and meiosis).
